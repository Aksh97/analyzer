 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * We declare two variables that will be defined and used in different files.
 * @graph_barrier is a POSIX thread barrier used to synchronize the main thread that runs the GraphChi algorithm
 * and the streaming thread that streams in new edges.
 * @stream_barrier is another thread barrier. Both @graph_barrier and @stream_barrier are used to perform chunk-based graph processing.
 * @stop is used to signal whether all vertices (including the streamed ones) have been proceeded and the algorithm can stop.
 * @base_graph_constructed is used to signal whether the base graph has been constructed.
